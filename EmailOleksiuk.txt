Subject : 'English' should be disable as a default 

Good morning Marcelo,

We have a question about the 'English' language link on the 'User info' page.

In the description of user story http://ssu-jira.softserveinc.com/browse/CHOSBB-113 
is identified that ‘English’ is enabled by default. At the same time is stated: it
means that English localization is disabled.

Could you please clarify these points.

Thank you,
Nadin Oleksiuk.
