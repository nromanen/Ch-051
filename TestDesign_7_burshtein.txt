1.	Build equivalence classes (partitions) based on given information
2.	Stand Out boundary values
3.	Cover requirements above by tests (write test cases’ names and objectives) based on equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis

2.	Decision tables
Supplier has a system of discounts to be provided to outlets he works with. An outlet has a constant 20% discount to any product in any order if this outlet is from the partners list. Another type of discount is a 15% discount provided for the product if more than 10 units are ordered. Besides these, the 10% discount might be provided for some products within promotional periods. The last type of discount can’t be used by outlets with constant discount.
