1.1.	Build equivalence classes (partitions) based on given information

Invalid		Valid for 50$				Valid for 500$ 			Valid for >500$			Invalid
<5$		>= 5$   0%  <50$			>=50$   1%  <500$		>=500$  3%  <=1000$		>1000$

1.2. Stand Out boundary values

Invalid		Valid for 50$		Valid for 500$ 		Valid for >500$		Invalid
4$		5$        49$		50$      499$		500$      1000$		1001$


2.1. Build decision table based on given information.

Inputs			C1	C2	C3	C4	C5	C6	C7	C8
Pensioner over 60	Y	Y	Y	Y 	N	N	N	N
Student			Y	Y	N	N	Y	Y 	N	N
Bought travel card 
in a rowduring last 
6 months 		Y	N	Y	N	Y	N	Y	N
Outputs
Discounts (%)		25	20	15	10	25	20	5	0
Error*			+	+						

Error means that the discounts for Students and Pensioners don’t sum up.


Rationalized table:
Inputs				C1	C2	C3	C4	C7	C8
Pensioner over 60		Y	Y	Y	Y 	N	N
Student				Y	Y	N	N	N	N
Bought travel card during 
last 6 months in a row		Y	N	Y	N	Y	N
Discounts (%)			25	20	15	10	5	0
Error*				+	+				


2.2. Test cases:
#	Condition	Outcome
1	Pensioner, has bought a travel card during last 6 months in a row						15% of discount
2	Pensioner, hasn’t bought a travel card during last 6 months in a row						10% of discount
3	Student, has bought a travel card during last 6 months in a row							25% of discount
4	Student, hasn’t bought a travel card during last 6 months in a row						20% of discount
5	A person (not a pensioner and not a student), has bought a travel card during last 6 months in a row		5% of discount
6	A person (not a pensioner and not a student), hasn’t bought a travel card during last 6 months in a row		0% of discount
