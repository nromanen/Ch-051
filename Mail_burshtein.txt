Hello Tom,

After reviewing the Customer opportunity to his/her 'Customer type' assigned according to his/her total orders sum the discrepancy of ranges were found.
They don’t match to the mock-up.  
At the same time we have the duplicate data on the crossing of the each type of the range.

To avoid misunderstanding I propose to change the ranges.

Proposal for changing:
Standard (no discount):	0-999
Silver (5% discount):	1000-2999
Gold (10% discount):	3000-9999
Platinum (15% discount): 10000+

Could you please approve.

In case you have any questions please contact me.

Regards,
Burshtein Tetiana
