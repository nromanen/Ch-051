Hello, Mike

We have some clarifications about the next stories:

1.Story CHOSBB-116 - As a Supervisor I want to edit existing product:

In our oppinion, it will be better to change the button 'Ok' into 'Save'.
After pressing the button 'Save', if some fields were changed, the modal dialog box should appear:
'Are you sure you want to save the changes? (Y/N)'. 
After pressing the button 'Cancel', if some fields were changed, the modal dialog box should appear:
'All changes will be lost. Are you sure you want to cancel? (Y/N)'.
If no fields were changed, after pressing buttons 'Save' or 'Cancel' the modal dialog box doesn't appear.

2.Story CHOSBB-117 - As a Supervisor I want to see and filter the list of products on 'Item Management' tab:

To change the field with links Delete into the field with the checkboxes and place this field
at the first position of the table. Add the button 'Delete selected'.
When you press the button and some checkboxes are checked, the modal dialog box should appear:
'Are you sure you want to delete selected items (count of selected items)? (Y/N)'.

Could you please, approve 
Best regards,
Olena Simanyuk.
